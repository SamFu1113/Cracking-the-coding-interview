# II. Behind the Scenes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most companies interview in a very similar way. In this chapter, we'll outline how some companies interview and what they value. This information will guide you on how to prepare for your interview and how to behave during and after the interview.

Once you are selected for an interview, you will usually go through a screening interview. This is usually done over the phone. Fresh job seekers studying at elite schools will likely experience such interviews face-to-face.

Don't let the name fool you. "Screening" interviews often involve coding and algorithm questions and the bar for an interview can be as high as an in-person interview. If you are not sure if the interview is technical, ask your recruiting coordinator what role your interviewer holds (or what the interview might cover) 。For instance, if you are an engineer, there is usually a technical interview.

Many companies take advantage of online sync document editors, but there are also some companies that want you to write the code on paper, and then read it back to the interviewer on the phone. Even some interviewers will give you "homework" after hanging up the phone, or just let you email them the code you wrote.

Before conducting an on-site interview, you will usually be screened by one or two interviewers.

During the on-site interview, you will usually have 3 to 6 face-to-face interviews. One of them is often at lunchtime. Lunch interviews are usually not technical, and the interviewer may not even submit feedback. You can discuss your hobbies with the interviewer, or ask about the company's corporate culture. Your other interviews are mostly technical, involving coding, algorithms, design/architecture and a combination of work history/experience questions.

Due to company priorities, size and sheer randomness, issues within the above topic range are distributed differently across companies and even across teams. Interviewers usually have a lot of latitude in interview questions.

After the interview, the interviewer will provide feedback in some form. In some companies, the interviewer will come together to discuss your performance and make a decision. In other companies, the interviewer will submit a proposal to the hiring manager or hiring committee to make a final decision.The interviewer doesn't even make a decision in some companies and their feedback is submitted directly to the hiring committee. It's up to them.

Most companies take their next move after a week (send offer, reject, further interviews, or just update the process). Feedback from some companies is fast (sometimes the same day!), while others took much longer to respond.

If you have waited more than a week, you should contact the recruiter. If your recruiter doesn't respond, it doesn't mean you're rejected (At least that's not the case at big tech companies, and pretty much everyone else) . Let me repeat it again. Failure to respond is not directly related to your interview status. That is to say, once the final decision is made, all recruiters should tell job applicants.

Delays can and do happen. If delays are expected, please contact the recruiter. But do so with respect. Recruiters are just like you and they can also be busy and forgetful at times.

### Microsoft interview

Microsoft wants smart people, geeks and people who love technology. You probably won't be inspected for C++ API calls, but you need to be able to write code on a whiteboard.

In a typical interview, you will be at Microsoft sometime in the morning and fill in some basic information. Then you will have a short interview as follow: a recruiter will give you a simple question. Recruiters are usually there to help you prepare the interview instead of asking you technical questions. If you are asked some basic technical questions, that could be because your recruiter wants to ease you into the interview. Therefore, when the "real" interview begins, you won't be so nervous.

Be kind to your recruiters. Because your recruiter may be your biggest advocate. If you fail in your first interview, they may even urge you to re-interview. they can get you a job or don't get it for you!

In the morning, you will have four or five interviews. Usually performed by two different teams. Unlike many companies, you meet the interviewer in a conference room. In Microsoft, you will meet with the interviewer in their office. It's a good time because you can look around and get a feel for the team culture.

Depending on the team, the interviewer may (or may not) share their feedback about you with the rest of the interview.

When you finish interviewing a team, you might talk to a hiring manager(often referred to as "as app" which is the abbreviation of "as appropriate"). If this is the case, that's a good sign! Because it most likely means that you passed an interview with a particular team. Now it's up to the hiring manager to decide.

You may receive a decision the same day, but it could also be a week. After a week of no news from HR, you could send a friendly email asking for a status update.

If your recruiters are unresponsive, it may be because she's busy rather than being silently rejected.

#### Necessary preparation

"Why do you want to work for Microsoft?"

In this question, Microsoft hopes to see your passion for technology. A good answer might be: "I've been using Microsoft software for as long as I can remember, and I've been impressed with how Microsoft has created a generally good product. For instance, I've been learning game programming using Visual Studio lately and its APl is excellent”. Please note that answers like this show a passion for technology!

#### Unique feature

Only when you're good, you will contact the hiring manager. Therefore, if you could talk to him(her), that's a great sign!

Furthermore, Microsoft tends to give teams more individual control and the product set is diverse. Since different teams value different aspects, so the experience of different departments within Microsoft can vary widely.

### Amazon interview

Amazon's hiring process usually starts with a video call and candidates are interviewed by a specific team. For a short period of time, candidates may have two or more interviews. It either indicates that one of their interviewers was not persuaded, or they were considered for a different team or pool. There are some more unusual circumstances. For instance, when a candidate has interviewed locally or recently for another position at the company, he might just have to do a phone interview.

The engineers interviewing you will usually ask you to write simple code through a shared documentation editor. Besides, they will also often ask a series of questions to explore technical areas that you are familiar with.

Next you're flying to Seattle (or whatever office you're interviewing for), and have four to five interviews with a team or two. These teams selected you based on your resume and phone interview. First you will have to be able to write code on the whiteboard, and some interviewers look for other skills as well. Interviewers are assigned a specific area to scout you, and they can look very different from each other. Before submitting your own feedback, they can't see other people's feedback. Besides, they discourage discussing this feedback before the recruiting meeting.

The "bar raiser" interviewer is responsible for maintaining the high standards of the interview. They participate in special training and interview candidates outside of the panel conducting the interview to balance the group interview feedback. If an interview seems very difficult and unusual, he is most likely the bar raiser. This person has extensive experience in interviewing, and he also has veto power over hiring decisions. However, remember if you had a hard time in this interview, it wouldn't mean you were actually performing poorly.Your performance is judged relative to other candidates, and it is not evaluated based on a simple "percent correct".

Once your interviewers have submitted their feedback, they will meet and discuss. They will be the ones making the hiring decisions.

While Amazon's recruiters are generally very good at following up with candidates, there are occasional delays. If you have not received an email from Amazon within a week, we suggest you send a friendly email with an inquiry.

#### Necessary preparations

Amazon places great emphasis on scaling the system. Therefore, make sure you are prepared for scalability issues. To answer these questions, you don't necessarily need a background in distributed systems. See our recommendations in the System Design and Scalability chapter.

Besides, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object-oriented design. I recommend looking at the Object-Oriented Design chapter for example problems and advice.

#### Unique feature

Bar Raiser was introduced by another team to maintain high standards. You need to impress both the person and the hiring manager.

Amazon is more prone to experimentation in its hiring process than other companies. The process described here is a typical interview experience, but thanks to Amazon's experiments, it doesn't have to be universal.

### Google interview

Rumors abound about Google interviews.But most of them are rumors.它的面试其实与 Microsoft 或 Amazon 的面试并没有太大不同。

一位 Google 工程师负责第一次电话面试，因此要对棘手的技术问题有个心理准备。这些问题可能涉及编码，有时需要通过共享文档进行编码。应聘者通常被要求遵守相同的标准，在电话视频面试（phone screens）上被问到的问题与现场面试（on-site）时类似。

在现场面试中，你将与四到六个面试官进行面试，其中一个是午餐面试官（lunch interviewer）。每个面试官的反馈对其他面试官是保密的，所以你可以放心，每次面试开始，面试官对你的印象都是空白的。你的午餐面试官不会提交反馈，所以这是一个问诚实问题的好机会。

面试官通常不会被限定到特定的关注点，我们也无法“结构性”地或“系统”地来回答你什么时候会被问到什么问题。每个面试官都可以按照自己的意愿进行面试。

书面反馈将提交给由工程师和经理组成的招聘委员会（HC），最终决定是录用还是不录用。面试反馈通常分为四类（分析能力、编码、经验和沟通），总分从 1.0 到 4.0。HC 通常不包括你的任何面试官。如果包括的话，那纯属偶然。

若发放 offer，HC 希望看到至少有一位面试官是“狂热的支持者（nthusiastic endorser）”。换句话说，得分分别为 3.6、3.1、3.1 和 2.6 的简历比所有得分都是 3.1 分的简历要好。

你不一定需要在每次面试中都表现出色，你的电话面试表现通常也不是影响最终决定的重要因素。

如果 HC 建议发放 offer，你的 packet 将提交给薪酬委员会，然后再提交给执行管理委员会。由于存在许多阶段和委员会，因此返回决策可能需要数周时间。

#### 必要的准备：

作为一个基于 web 的公司，Google 关心的是如何设计一个可扩展的系统。因此，请确保你准备好了回答系统设计和可扩展性方面的问题。

不论经验如何，Google 都非常重视候选人的分析（算法）技能。即使你认为以前的经验值得考虑，你也应该为这些问题做好充分的准备。

#### 不同之处：

你的面试官不会做出雇用决定。相反，他们会将反馈信息提交给招聘委员会。招聘委员会将给出一个决定，而 Google 高管有权回绝掉这个决定，虽然他们很少这样做。

### Apple 面试

就像 Apple 公司本身一样，Apple 的面试程序也没有什么官僚作风。面试官将寻求优秀的技术技能，但是对职位和公司的热情也很重要。虽然求职者是否为 Mac 用户不是先决条件，但你至少应该熟悉这个系统。

面试过程通常从招聘人员的电话视频面试开始，了解你的基本技能，然后是一系列与团队成员进行的技术电话视频面试。

一旦你被邀请进入园区，通常会是招募人员来向你打招呼，并向你介绍整个招聘流程。然后，你将与申请的职位所在团队的成员，以及与你团队合作的关键人物，进行进行 6~8 次面试。

你需要对一对一（one-on-one）和二对一（two-on-one）的混合面试有心理预期。准备好在白板上写代码，并确保你所有的想法都清楚地传达出来。午餐是和你未来的潜在经理一起吃的，看起来比较随意，但这仍然是一次面试。每个面试官通常专注于一个不同的领域，通常不提倡与其他面试官分享反馈，除非他们想让后续面试官深入了解一些东西。

在一天结束时，你的面试官会互相交换意见。如果每个人都觉得你是一个可行的候选人，你将会和你申请的公司的主管和副总裁进行面试。虽然这个决定是非正式的，但如果你到了这一步，是一个很好的迹象。这一决定也会在幕后发生，如果你不通过，你就会被护送出大楼，而（直到现在）你也不会察觉。

如果你参加过了主管和副总裁的面试，你所有的面试官都会聚集在一个会议室里，给你一个正式的赞成（thumbs up）或反对（thumbs down）。副总裁一般不会出席，但如果他们对招聘不满意，仍然可以否决。招聘人员通常会在几天后跟进，但你可以随时联系他/她，了解最新情况。

#### 必要的准备：

如果你知道你面试的是哪个团队，确保你仔细了解了他们的产品。你喜欢它什么？你能改进什么？提供具体的建议可以显示你对这份工作的热情。

#### 独特之处：

Apple 经常进行二对一的面试，但是不要为此感到压力——这和一对一的面试是一样的！

此外，Apple 员工是 Apple 的铁杆粉丝。你应该在面试中表现出同样的热情。

### Facebook 面试
一旦被选中参加面试，应聘者通常会进行一两个电话视频面试。电话面试将是技术性的，并且会涉及编码，通常是使用线文档编辑器。

在电话面试之后，你可能会被要求做一个家庭作业，其中包括编码和算法的混合题目。在这里注意你的编码风格。如果你从未在一个有完整代码评审（code review）的环境中工作过，那么找一个必须评审你代码的人可能是个好主意。

在现场面试中，你将主要与其他软件工程师进行面试，但只要招聘经理有空，他们也会参与进来。所有的面试官都经过了全面的面试培训，与你进行面试的人是跟你获得 offer 的几率没有联系的。

在现场面试中，每位面试官都被赋予一个“角色”，这有助于确保没有重复的问题，并且可以全面了解候选人。这些角色是：

- **工作经历（“绝地武士（Jedi）”）**：这个面试评估你在 Facebook 的环境下取得成功的能力。你能很好地适应这种文化和价值观吗？你对什么感到兴奋？你如何应对挑战？请准备好谈论你对 Facebook 的兴趣，因为 Facebook 需要的是有激情的人。在这次面试中，你可能还会被问到一些编码问题。

- **编码和算法（“忍者（Ninja）”）**：这些是标准编码和算法问题，就像你在本书中会发现的一样。这些问题被设计成极具有挑战性。你可以使用任何你想用的编程语言。

- **设计/架构（“海盗（Pirate）”）**：对于后端软件工程师，你可能会被问到系统设计问题。前端或其他专业将被问及与该学科相关的设计问题。你应该开放地讨论不同的解决方案及其权衡。

通常，你需要做好进行两次“忍者”面试和一次“绝地”面试的准备。经验丰富的候选人通常也将接受一次“海盗”面试。面试结束后，面试官在互相讨论你的表现之前会提交书面反馈。这可以确保你在一次面试中的表现不会因其他面试官的反馈而产生偏见。

一旦每个人的反馈都被提交，你的面试团队和招聘经理会聚在一起，共同做出最终决定。他们达成共识，并向招聘委员会提交了最终的招聘建议。

#### 必要的准备：

作为“精英”科技公司中最年轻的一家，Facebook 希望开发人员具有创业精神。在面试中，你应该表现出你喜欢快速构建东西。

他们想知道，你可以使用任何一种选择的语言共同构建出一个优雅的、可扩展的解决方案。了解 PHP 并不是特别重要，特别是考虑到 Facebook 还使用 C++、Python、Erlang 和其他语言做了大量后端工作。

#### 独特之处：

Facebook “一般来说“是从整个公司层面出发来面试开发人员的，而不是为某个特定的团队。如果你被录用，你将参加一个为期六周的“训练营”，这将帮助你在庞大的代码库中不断提升。你将获得高级开发人员的指导，学习最佳实践，最终，在选择项目时，你将获得比在面试中分配到项目时更大的灵活性。

### Palantir 面试

不像有些公司会进行“合并（pooled）”面试（你是从整个公司的角度被面试的，而不是针对某个特定的团队），Palantir 是为一个特定的团队进行面试的。有时候，你的申请可能会被更改到（re-routed）到另一个更合适的团队。

Palantir 的面试流程通常从两次电话面试开始。这些面试大约 30 到 45 分钟，并且主要是技术性的。希望你能介绍一些你以前的经验，并将重点放在算法相关的问题上。

你还可能需要接受一次 HackerRank 编码评估，它将评估你编写最优算法和正确代码的能力。经验不足的求职者，比如大学毕业生，特别有可能参加这样的测试。

在此之后，成功的候选人将被邀请到园区，并将接受多达五人的面试。现场面试的内容涵盖了你以前的经验、相关的领域知识、数据结构和算法，以及系统设计。

你还可能得到 Palantir 产品的演示。问一些好的问题，并展示你对公司的热情。

面试结束后，面试官会和招聘经理开会讨论面试反馈结果。

#### 必要的准备：

Palantir看重雇佣优秀的工程师。许多求职者表示，Palantir的问题比他们在谷歌和其他顶级公司遇到的问题更难回答。这并不一定意味着获得一份工作更难（尽管确实可以）;这只是意味着面试官更喜欢更具挑战性的问题。如果你在面试 Palantir，你应该彻底了解核心数据结构和算法。然后，集中精力准备最难的算法问题。

如果你正在面试一个后端职位，也要温习一下系统设计。这是这个过程的一个重要部分。

#### 独特之处：

编写代码是 Palantir 面试流程中的常见部分。尽管你可以使用计算机，并且可以根据需要查找资料，但不要毫无准备地走进办公室。这些问题可能极具挑战性，并且将评估算法的效率。充分的面试准备将对你有所帮助。你也可以在 `HackerRank.com` 网站上在线练习编程挑战。

## Preface


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Reader, let's start with an introduction. I am not a recruiter. I am a software engineer. Therefore, I know what it's like to be asked to come up with a brilliant algorithm on the spot and then write the perfect code on a whiteboard. The reason I know it's because I've been asked to do the same thing in interviews at Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon and others.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, I also stood on the other side of the table and asked my candidates to do the same thing. I used to find engineers who I thought might pass the interview, and looked through piles of resumes. I used to evaluate them when they were solving or trying to solve challenging problems. I've also argued in Google's Hiring Committee whether a candidate performed well enough to get the job. I am familiar with the entire recruitment process because I went through every step of it, over and over again.




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you, the reader may be preparing for an interview tomorrow, next week or next year. I'm here to help you solidify your understanding of the fundamentals of computer science and then learn how to apply these basics to crack coding interviews. 

The 6th edition *Cracking the Coding Interview* has been updated from the 5th edition, e.g. adding 70% content about dditional questions, revised answer, new chapter introductio, more algorithmic strategies, and tips for all questions and more. Please visit our website: *CrackingTheCodinglnterview.com* and connect with other job seekers and discover new resources.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so happy for you and the skills you will develop. Adequate preparation will help you broaden your knowledge and improve communication skills. No matter how hard you try, it's all worth it! It is recommended that you read these introductory chapters carefully. In these chapters I have recorded some important insights. Maybe the final result that affects you is "hire", or "no hire".

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also keep in mind that interviews are hard! I've had some interviewers ask "noticeable" questions in the past few years of interviewing at Google. On the other hand, other interviewers will ask slightly more difficult questions. But guess what? Simple questions don't make it easier for you to get an offer. Getting an offer doesn't mean you can solve a problem perfectly(Few job seekers can do it!). Instead, you are asked to give a better answer than other job applicants.  
So when you encounter tough problems, do not worry——其他人可能都认为它很难。做不到完美也没有关系。

Study hard, practice-and good luck!

# I. The interview process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most top tech companies (and many others), algorithms and coding questions are the biggest components of the interview process. These types of problems can be thought of as problem-solving problems. The interviewer wants to be able to observe your process of solving algorithmic problems that you have not encountered before to assess your abilities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, you may only have one question in an interview. Because 45 minutes is not long, it is difficult for you to answer several different questions all within this time.

Throughout the problem-solving process, you should speak your plan out loud and explain your thought process. Your interviewer sometimes jumps out to guide you. Let them do it. This is normal and it doesn't mean you're doing badly.(Of course, it would be better without a hint.)  

Interviewers generally have an intuitive feel for your performance after the interview. They might rate your performance, but this is not a quantitative evaluation. There are no graphs showing how many points you get on different things. The interview itself doesn't like work like that.


On the contrary, your interviewer evaluates your performance usually based on the following points:

- **Skills of Analyze**：Do you need a lot of help to solve a problem? How good is your solution? How long did it take you to find a solution? If you have to design/architecture a new solution. Did you organize the questions well and consider the trade-offs of different decisions?

- **Coding Level**：Are you able to successfully convert the algorithm into reasonable code? Is it clean and orderly? Have you considered potential mistakes? Is your code style good?

- **Technical Knowledge/Computer Science Fundamentals**：Do you have a solid foundation in computer science and related technologies?

- **Experience**：Have you made technical decisions well in the past? Have you done interesting, challenging projects? Do you show motivation, initiative, and other important factors?

- **Culture Fitting/Communication Skills**：Do your personality and values ​​fit with the company and the team? Are you able to communicate well with the interviewer?

The weighting of these areas will vary depending on the question, interviewer, role, team, and company. In a standard algorithmic problem, it mainly examines almost exactly the first three aspects.

### Why?
This is one of the most frequently asked questions by job seekers at the start of an interview. Why are interviews designed this way? After all:

1. Many good job candidates don't do well in these types of interviews.

2. If it does, you can find the answer directly.

3. In practical work, it is rarely necessary to use data structures such as binary search trees. If you really need, uou can definitely learn it.

4. Whiteboard coding is an artificial environment. Obviously, In real work you would never write code on a whiteboard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These complaints are not without reason. In fact, I agree with all of them at least in part.

In the meanwhile, we have reasons for certain positions(not all positions) to take this approach. Agreeing with this logic doesn't matter, but it's a good idea to understand why you're asking these questions. It can help you gain insight into the mindset of the interviewer.

#### False negatives are acceptable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's sad (and frustrating for candidates), but this is the truth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the company's point of view, it is actually acceptable for some good candidates to be rejected. If the company intends to cultivate a group of outstanding employees, they can accept missing out on some good people.
Of course, they don't want to do it either because it will increase their recruitment costs. However, this is an acceptable compromise as long as they can still hire enough good people. They are more concerned about false positives:Those who do well in interviews but it's not actually very good.

#### Problem-solving skills are valuable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can solve a few puzzles (perhaps with some help), you are probably very good at developing optimal algorithms. In other words, you are smart. Smart people tend to do things well, and this is valuable to the company. Of course, it's not the only thing that matters, but it's a very good thing.

#### Knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms is useful.

The interviewer will think that basic computer science knowledge is actually useful. You hae to keep in mid that situations that require knowledge of trees, graphs, lists, sorting, and other things will certainly arise from time to time. 
If so, it is really necessary to have knowledge of books.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't it be possible to selectively learn as needed when faced with a problem? Of, course. But if you don't know the existence of binary search trees, it's hard to know when to use it when you need it. If you know it exists, then you have the basic concept.

Other interviewers based on data structure and algorithm related questions to exhibitors because it's  they think it's a good "proxy". Even though the skills themselves are not difficult to learn, they said it has a lot to do with being a good developer. 
This means you have passed a computer science course(in this case, you have acquired and retained fairly extensive technical knowledge), or you are self-taught these things. This is all a good sign anyway.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for the emergence of knowledge of data structures and algorithms is it's hard to ask problem-solving problems that don't involve them. It turns out that the vast majority of problem-solving problems involve some of these basics. When enough candidates understand these basics, 
it's easy to get into a mode of asking them questions.

#### Whiteboards allow you to focus on what's important.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing perfect code on a whiteboard is very difficult,这是绝对肯定的。幸运的是，你的面试官对此并没有苛求。实际上，每个人都有一些 bug 或轻微的语法错误。

白板的好处在于，在某种程度上，你可以专注于大局。你没有编译器。所以你不需要编译代码。你不需要编写整个类定义和样板代码。你可以关注代码中有趣的、“充实的”部分：该问题真正关注的功能。

这并不是说你应该只写伪代码或者正确性无关紧要。大多数面试官不接受伪代码，并且希望错误越少越好。

白板也倾向于鼓励候选人多发言，并解释他们的思维过程。当给应聘者一台电脑时，他们的沟通能力会大幅下降。

#### 但这并不适用于每个人、每个公司或每种情况。

以上部分旨在帮助你了解公司的思维过程。

我的个人想法？ 对于正确的情况，如果面试过程处理得当，是能够帮助对一个人解决问题能力做出的合理判断的，因为表现优秀的人往往相当聪明。

然而，许多面试过程体验的并不好。你可能会遇到你的面试官很差劲，或者他们问的问题也很差劲。

它也不适合所有的公司。有些公司应该更重视员工以前的经验，或者需要掌握特定技术的技能。那么这类问题并没有太大分量。

它也不能衡量一个人的职业道德或专注力。再说一次，几乎没有面试过程能真正评估这一点。

无论如何，这都不是一个完美的过程，但什么是完美的过程呢？事实上所有的面试过程都有其缺点。

我只能说：事情就是这样，所以我们只能尽自己所能。

### 面试题是如何被选择的
应聘者经常会问在某家公司“最近”的面试问题是什么。仅仅问这个问题就揭示了他对问题来源的根本性误解。

在绝大多数公司，面试官该问的问题并没有一个清单。相反，每个面试官都会选择他们自己的问题。

因为就问题而言，它是“对任何人都开放的（free for all）”，所以没有什么能让一个问题成为“最近 Google 面试的问题”，除了一个碰巧在 Google 工作的面试官最近碰巧问了这个问题。

今年 Google 面试被问到的的问题与三年前的问题并没有太大区别。事实上， Google 提出的问题通常与在类似公司（Amazon、Facebook等）提出的问题没有什么不同。

不同公司之间存在着一些广泛的差异。一些公司专注于算法（通常被用于一些系统设计），而另一些公司则非常喜欢基于知识的问题。但在一个给定的问题类别中，几乎没有什么能让它“属于”一家公司，而不是另一家公司。Google 的算法问题和 Facebook 的算法问题本质上是一样的。

### 一切都是相对的

如果没有评分系统，你是如何被评估的？面试官如何知道你的期望？

好问题。一旦理解了，答案就会变得很有意义。

面试官会通过在同一个面试官的同一个问题上的表现评估你与其他候选人的优劣。这是一个相对比较。

例如，假设你想出了一个很酷的新脑筋急转弯或数学问题。你问你的朋友 Alex 这个问题，他花了30分钟来解决它。你问 Bella，她花了50分钟。Chris 永远也解不出来。Dexter 需要15分钟，但你必须给他一些重要的提示，如果没有这些提示，他可能会花更长的时间。Ellie 采用了 10 种方法，并提出了一个你甚至都不知道的替代方法。Fred 需要35分钟。

你会走开，说道，“哇，Ellie 表现得真不错。我敢打赌她的数学一定很好。”（当然，很有可能只是她比较走运，而 Chris 不走运。你可能会问更多的问题，以确保这不是因为运气好或运气坏。）

面试问题也是如此。面试官通过将你与其他人进行比较，会对你的表现有所了解。当然这和她那周面试的候选人无关，而是基于她曾经问过这个问题的所有候选人的表现。

因此，被问到一个很难的问题并不是一件坏事。如果对你来说很难，那对每个人来说也都是很难的。这并不会降低你成功的可能性。

### FAQ

#### 我在面试后没有立即收到回复。我被拒绝了吗？
不。公司的决定可能会被推迟，原因有很多。一个非常简单的解释是，你的一位面试官还没有给出他们的反馈。很少有公司的政策是不回应他们拒绝的候选人。

如果你在面试后的 3~5 个工作日内没有收到任何公司的回复，礼貌地和招聘人员联系。

#### 我被拒绝后可以重新申请公司吗？

几乎都是可以的，但你通常需要等待一段时间（6 个月到 1 年）。当你重新面试时，你的第一次不良面试通常不会对你产生太大的影响。许多人曾被 Google 或 Microsoft 拒绝过，但后来都得到了他们的 offer。

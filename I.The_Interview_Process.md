# I. The interview process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most top tech companies (and many others), algorithms and coding questions are the biggest components of the interview process. These types of problems can be thought of as problem-solving problems. The interviewer wants to be able to observe your process of solving algorithmic problems that you have not encountered before to assess your abilities.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, you may only have one question in an interview. Because 45 minutes is not long, it is difficult for you to answer several different questions all within this time.

Throughout the problem-solving process, you should speak your plan out loud and explain your thought process. Your interviewer sometimes jumps out to guide you. Let them do it. This is normal and it doesn't mean you're doing badly.(Of course, it would be better without a hint.)  

Interviewers generally have an intuitive feel for your performance after the interview. They might rate your performance, but this is not a quantitative evaluation. There are no graphs showing how many points you get on different things. The interview itself doesn't like work like that.


On the contrary, your interviewer evaluates your performance usually based on the following points:

- **Skills of Analyze**：Do you need a lot of help to solve a problem? How good is your solution? How long did it take you to find a solution? If you have to design/architecture a new solution. Did you organize the questions well and consider the trade-offs of different decisions?

- **Coding Level**：Are you able to successfully convert the algorithm into reasonable code? Is it clean and orderly? Have you considered potential mistakes? Is your code style good?

- **Technical Knowledge/Computer Science Fundamentals**：Do you have a solid foundation in computer science and related technologies?

- **Experience**：Have you made technical decisions well in the past? Have you done interesting, challenging projects? Do you show motivation, initiative, and other important factors?

- **Culture Fitting/Communication Skills**：Do your personality and values ​​fit with the company and the team? Are you able to communicate well with the interviewer?

The weighting of these areas will vary depending on the question, interviewer, role, team, and company. In a standard algorithmic problem, it mainly examines almost exactly the first three aspects.

### Why?
This is one of the most frequently asked questions by job seekers at the start of an interview. Why are interviews designed this way? After all:

1. Many good job candidates don't do well in these types of interviews.

2. If it does, you can find the answer directly.

3. In practical work, it is rarely necessary to use data structures such as binary search trees. If you really need, uou can definitely learn it.

4. Whiteboard coding is an artificial environment. Obviously, In real work you would never write code on a whiteboard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These complaints are not without reason. In fact, I agree with all of them at least in part.

In the meanwhile, we have reasons for certain positions(not all positions) to take this approach. Agreeing with this logic doesn't matter, but it's a good idea to understand why you're asking these questions. It can help you gain insight into the mindset of the interviewer.

#### False negatives are acceptable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's sad (and frustrating for candidates), but this is the truth.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the company's point of view, it is actually acceptable for some good candidates to be rejected. If the company intends to cultivate a group of outstanding employees, they can accept missing out on some good people.
Of course, they don't want to do it either because it will increase their recruitment costs. However, this is an acceptable compromise as long as they can still hire enough good people. They are more concerned about false positives:Those who do well in interviews but it's not actually very good.

#### Problem-solving skills are valuable.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can solve a few puzzles (perhaps with some help), you are probably very good at developing optimal algorithms. In other words, you are smart. Smart people tend to do things well, and this is valuable to the company. Of course, it's not the only thing that matters, but it's a very good thing.

#### Knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms is useful.

The interviewer will think that basic computer science knowledge is actually useful. You hae to keep in mid that situations that require knowledge of trees, graphs, lists, sorting, and other things will certainly arise from time to time. 
If so, it is really necessary to have knowledge of books.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't it be possible to selectively learn as needed when faced with a problem? Of, course. But if you don't know the existence of binary search trees, it's hard to know when to use it when you need it. If you know it exists, then you have the basic concept.

Other interviewers based on data structure and algorithm related questions to exhibitors because it's  they think it's a good "proxy". Even though the skills themselves are not difficult to learn, they said it has a lot to do with being a good developer. 
This means you have passed a computer science course(in this case, you have acquired and retained fairly extensive technical knowledge), or you are self-taught these things. This is all a good sign anyway.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for the emergence of knowledge of data structures and algorithms is it's hard to ask problem-solving problems that don't involve them. It turns out that the vast majority of problem-solving problems involve some of these basics. When enough candidates understand these basics, 
it's easy to get into a mode of asking them questions.

#### Whiteboards allow you to focus on what's important.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing perfect code on a whiteboard is very difficult and this is absolutely certain. Fortunately, your interviewer is not demanding about it. In fact, everyone has some bug or slight syntax error.

The advantage of a whiteboard is that you can focus on the big picture in a way. You don't have a compiler so you don't need to compile the code. You don't need to write the whole class definition and boilerplate code. You can focus on the interesting and "flesh" parts of the code that is the functionality that the question really focuses on.

That's not to say you should just write pseudocode or that correctness doesn't matter. Most interviewers don't accept pseudocode and hopefully the fewer errors the better.

Whiteboards also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process. When giving candidates a computer, their ability to communicate will be drastically reduced.

#### But that doesn't apply to every person, company, or situation.

The above sections are designed to help you understand the company's thought process. What about my personal opinion? If the interview process is handled properly, he(she)is capable of assisting in making reasonable judgments about a person's problem-solving abilities for the correct case. Because high performers are often pretty smart.

However, many interview process experiences are not very good. You may encounter your interviewer who is bad or they ask bad questions.

It is not suitable for all companies. Some companies should pay more attention to the previous experience of employees or skills that require mastery of a specific technology. Well, such questions don't have much weight.

Nor does it measure a person's work ethic or focus.Again, few interview processes really assess this.

Anyway, it's not a perfect process. However, what is the perfect process? Virtually all interview processes have their downsides.

I can only say that's the way it is, so we can only do our best.

### How the interview questions were chosen

Candidates were often asked what was the "most recent" interview question at a company. Just asking the question revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the source of the problem.

There is no list of questions an interviewer should ask in most companies. On the contrary, each interviewer chooses their own questions.

Because as far as the problem is concerned, it is "free for all". Therefore, nothing makes a question "a recent Google interview question". Except that an interviewer who happened to work at Google happened to ask this question recently.

The questions asked in this year's Google interviews aren't too different from the ones asked three years ago. In fact, the questions asked by Google are usually no different from those asked at similar companies (Amazon, Facebook, etc.).

There are some broad differences between companies. Some companies specialize in algorithms (often used in some system design), while others are very fond of knowledge-based questions. However, within a given problem category,几乎没有什么能让它“属于”一家公司，而不是另一家公司。Google 的算法问题和 Facebook 的算法问题本质上是一样的。

### Everything is relative

Without a scoring system, how were you evaluated? How do interviewers know what to expect from you?

It's a good question. Once you understood, the answer becomes meaningful.

The interviewer will evaluate you against other candidates by your performance on the same question from the same interviewer. This is a relative comparison.

For instance, say you come up with a cool new brain teaser or math problem. You ask your friend Alex this question, and it took him 30 minutes to fix it. On the other hand, you ask Bella and she took 50 minutes. On the other hand, Chris can never figure it out. Dexter spends 15 minutes, but you have to give him some important tips. Without these tips, he may spend longer time. Ellie uses 10 methods and came up with an alternative you didn't even know about. Fred needs 35 minutes finally.

You will go away and say “Wow, Ellie is doing really well. I bet she's pretty good at math.” (Of course, it's possible that she was just lucky and Chris was out of luck. You may ask more questions to make sure it's not due to good or bad luck.) 

The same goes for interview questions. By comparing you to other people, the interviewer will get an idea of ​​your performance. Of course, it had nothing to do with the candidates she interviewed that week. Rather, it's based on the performance of all the candidates she's ever asked the question.

Therefore, it's not a bad thing to be asked a hard question. If it's hard for you, that's hard for everyone too. This doesn't reduce your chances of success.

### FAQ

#### I didn't hear back immediately after the interview. Am I being rejected?

No. The company's decision may be delayed. There are many reasons. A very simple explanation is that one of your interviewers has yet to give their feedback. But few companies have a policy of not responding to candidates they reject.

If you do not receive a response from any company within 3-5 working days after the interview,Contact the recruiter politely.

#### 我被拒绝后可以重新申请公司吗？

几乎都是可以的，但你通常需要等待一段时间（6 个月到 1 年）。当你重新面试时，你的第一次不良面试通常不会对你产生太大的影响。许多人曾被 Google 或 Microsoft 拒绝过，但后来都得到了他们的 offer。

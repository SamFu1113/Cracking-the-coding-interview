## Introduction

#### Where is wrong

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked out of the job fair again in frustration. None of the 10 candidates surveyed that day will receive an offer. We are thinking, are we too harsh? I am especially disappointed. We rejected one of my candidates. He is a student I have taught before. He obtained a 3.73 GPA at the University of Washington, one of the best computer science schools in the world, and has done a lot of work on open source projects. He is full of energy. He is very creative. He is very keen. He works hard. He is a true geek in all aspects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to agree with other members of the committee: these data do not explain the problem. Even if my strong recommendation can convince them to reconsider, he will definitely be eliminated in the subsequent recruitment process. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he exposed too many red flags. Although he is very smart, he is very difficult to solve the interview questions. The first question in the interview is a variant of a classic question. Most successful job applicants can answer quickly, but
he has trouble with the algorithm development of this question. When he proposed a plan, he did not consider a solution optimized for other scenarios.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, when coding, he quickly finished the code with the original solution idea, 
but the code was full of errors that he hadn't noticed. Although from any point of view, he is not the worst candidate we have ever seen, but he is far from "bar" (translator's note, benchmark). So, refuse.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks later, when he asked for feedback on the phone, I was struggling not to know how to answer him. smarter? No, I know he is very smart. To be a better coder? No, his technique is comparable to some of the best I have ever seen.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many active job seekers, he is well prepared. He has read K&R's classic C language books, and also reviewed CLRS's famous algorithm textbook. He can describe countless ways of balancing trees in detail, and he can use C to do things that no sane programmer would consider doing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to tell him an unfortunate fact that just reading those books is not enoug. Academic books can prepare you for novel research, and they might make you a better software enginee, but they are not enough for interviews. Why? Let me give you a hint, which is your interviewer has not seen a red-black tree because they were in school either.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To crack a coding interview, you need to prepare real interview questions. You have to practice on real problems, 并学习它们的模式。最终能实现灵活开发新的算法，而不是死记硬背现有的问题。

**Cracking the Coding Interview** 一书是我根据在一线公司参与面试并在之后指导求职者通过面试的第一手经验所总结的成果。它是与求职者数百次对话的成果。它是汇总候选人和面试官提出的数千个问题的成果。它也是参考了这么多公司的这么多面试问题的成果。本书收录了 189 个最好的面试问题，这是从成千上万个可能的问题中挑选出来的。

#### 我的方法

**Cracking the Coding Interview** 的重点是算法、编码和设计问题。为什么？因为虽然你可以也会被问到工作经验方面的问题（behavioral question），但答案会和你的简历一样五花八门。同样，虽然许多公司会问一些所谓的 “trivia” 问题（例如，“什么是虚拟功能？”），但是通过实践这些问题而获得的技能仅限于非常具体的知识。本书将简要介绍其中的一些问题，向你展示它们是什么样的，但我选择将空间分配给需要学习更多内容的领域。

#### 我的爱好

教学是我的爱好。我喜欢帮助人们理解新概念，并为他们提供工具来帮助他们在他们爱好的领域中脱颖而出。

我第一次正式的教学经历是宾夕法尼亚大学，当时我在第二年成为一名计算机科学本科课程的助教。我接受了 TA 的其他几门课程，最后我在那里开设了自己的计算机科学课程，侧重于实践技能。

作为 Google 的工程师，培训和指导新工程师是我最喜欢的事情之一。我甚至利用我的 “20％ 时间” 在华盛顿大学教授两门计算机科学课程。

多年后的今天，我继续教授计算机科学的概念，但这一次的目标是让初创公司的工程师为他们的 acquisition interview 做准备。我已经看到他们的错误和努力，并且为帮助他们解决这些问题制定了技术和策略。

**Cracking the Coding Interview**、**Cracking the PM Interview**、**Cracking the Tech Career** 和 **CareerCup**，都体现了我对教学的热爱。即使是现在，你也经常可以在 *CareerCup.com* 上看到我在 “闲逛”，以帮助那些寻求帮助的用户。

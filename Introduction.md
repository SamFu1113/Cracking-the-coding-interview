## Introduction

#### Where is wrong?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We walked out of the job fair again in frustration. None of the 10 candidates surveyed that day will receive an offer. We are thinking, are we too harsh? I am especially disappointed. We rejected one of my candidates. He is a student I have taught before. He obtained a 3.73 GPA at the University of Washington, one of the best computer science schools in the world, and has done a lot of work on open source projects. He is full of energy. He is very creative. He is very keen. He works hard. He is a true geek in all aspects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have to agree with other members of the committee: these data do not explain the problem. Even if my strong recommendation can convince them to reconsider, he will definitely be eliminated in the subsequent recruitment process. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he exposed too many red flags. Although he is very smart, he is very difficult to solve the interview questions. The first question in the interview is a variant of a classic question. Most successful job applicants can answer quickly, but
he has trouble with the algorithm development of this question. When he proposed a plan, he did not consider a solution optimized for other scenarios.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, when coding, he quickly finished the code with the original solution idea, 
but the code was full of errors that he hadn't noticed. Although from any point of view, he is not the worst candidate we have ever seen, but he is far from "bar" (translator's note, benchmark). So, refuse.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks later, when he asked for feedback on the phone, I was struggling not to know how to answer him. smarter? No, I know he is very smart. To be a better coder? No, his technique is comparable to some of the best I have ever seen.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many active job seekers, he is well prepared. He has read K&R's classic C language books, and also reviewed CLRS's famous algorithm textbook. He can describe countless ways of balancing trees in detail, and he can use C to do things that no sane programmer would consider doing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to tell him an unfortunate fact that just reading those books is not enoug. Academic books can prepare you for novel research, and they might make you a better software enginee, but they are not enough for interviews. Why? Let me give you a hint, which is your interviewer has not seen a red-black tree because they were in school either.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To crack a coding interview, you need to prepare real interview questions. You have to practice on real problems, and learn their patterns.
Ultimately you will enable to develope flexible and new algorithms, rather than rote existing problems.

**Cracking the Coding Interview**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is based on my first-hand experience in interviewing at front-line companies and then guiding job candidates through interviews. It is the result of hundreds of conversations with job candidates. It is the result of aggregating thousands of questions from candidates and interviewers. It is also the result of referencing so many interview questions from so many companies. This book contains 189 of the best interview questions, This is selected from thousands of possible problems.  

#### My method

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Cracking the Coding Interview** focuses on algorithms, coding and design Issues Why? Although you will be asked about work experienc such as behavioral questions, the answers will be as varied as your resume. Similarly, although many companies will ask some so-called "trivial" questions(eg, What is a virtual function?), the skills gained by practicing these questions are limited to very specific knowledge. This book will briefly address some of these issues and show you what they are like, but I choose to allocate space to areas that need to learn more.

#### My hobby

Teaching is my hobby. I love helping people understand new concepts, and provide them with tools to help them excel in their field of passion.
My first formal teaching experience was at the University of Pennsylvania, at the time I was in my second year as a teaching assistant in a computer science undergraduate program. I took several other courses from TA, I ended up doing my own computer science course there, and focus on practical skills.

As an engineer at Google, training and mentoring new engineers is one of my favorite things.  I even use my "20% time" to teach two computer science courses at the University of Washington.

Many years later, I continue to teach computer science concepts, but this time the goal is to get the startup's engineers to prepare for their acquisition interview.  I have seen their mistakes and efforts and developed techniques and strategies to help them solve these problems.

**Cracking the Coding Interview**、**Cracking the PM Interview**、**Cracking the Tech Career** 和 **CareerCup**，都体现了我对教学的热爱。即使是现在，你也经常可以在 *CareerCup.com* 上看到我在 “闲逛”，以帮助那些寻求帮助的用户。

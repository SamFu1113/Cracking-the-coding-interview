## Preface

[comment]: <> (The translator likes to visit one-acre three-quarters forums when he is fishing, and he stumbled upon the book CtCI in the "Lifelong Learning" section. This book is hailed as a classic book on job interviews for code farmers in North America. , Because the book contains 189 coding questions, it is also called CC189, and the earlier version is CC150.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book introduces the interview process of first-line Internet companies such as Microsoft and Google. It explains how to prepare for the interview and how to answer technical questions. It also teaches you how to evaluate the choice of offers and how to negotiate with HR. Of course, time complexity, space complexity and specific interview questions are the focus of this book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 189 questions in this book are dominated by data institutions and algorithms, and their questions and answers occupy most of the content of this book. In addition, there is a chapter covering distributed system design, C/C++, Java, database, multi-threading and other knowledge content, but these contents are almost superficial, aiming to provide readers with a simple but systematic knowledge framework, so that Readers can aim to strengthen the training according to their weaknesses. These 189 questions cover most of the question types you may encounter in a programming interview. The questions are easy and difficult, and all the questions are given more conventional problem-solving ideas and answers. The implementation of the algorithmic questions uses the Java language. Of course, some solutions are not optimal, if you are interested, you can try to give the optimal solution yourself on this basis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like reading the OG before taking the GMAT, this book is an introductory book for programming interviews. If you have worked for many years and need to pick up data structures and algorithms again, this book is suitable for you; but if you are a big cow who has played algorithmic competitions such as ACM or engaged in algorithms-related work, then this book is You can skip it directly. Since it is oriented to coding interviews, this book can't avoid its utilitarian nature. If you just want to learn algorithms, you can read Programming Pearls and other books. Compared with the actual interview, the topic of this book is still slightly simpler. If you want to improve it further, it is recommended to go to Leetcode to write the questions and digest and summarize by yourself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, the Yimu Sanfendi forum often mentions another book: [Programming Interview Exposed](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/1118261364/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=1point3acres-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f4a9f284abef2e91bbc0bc39a9cc3967&camp=1789&creative=9325), this book is a bit more basic, non-science students with zero foundation can try to start with this book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I suggest that capable readers should read the original English version of this book.

**APPEND**: As reminded by v2ex netizens, the official Chinese version of this book has been published, the Chinese name is the programmer interview golden classic (the translator can't help but complain about this translation), the sixth edition is issued in September 19, no wonder The translator was not found at the time. Therefore, the translator here recommends that you buy books through official channels if necessary. This project can be used for translation comparison and communication.
